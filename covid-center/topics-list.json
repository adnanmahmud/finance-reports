   "Details": "<h3>How COVID-19  Spreads</h3><p>The virus is thought to spread mainly from <i>person-to-person</i>, especially those who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). The virus spreads through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.</p><p>People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest). While some spread might be possible before people show symptoms, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p><p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p><p>Community spread seems to be happening in some geographic areas. \"\"Community Spread\"\" means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p><p>More details <a href=\"\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">here</a> from CDC.\"</p>"
