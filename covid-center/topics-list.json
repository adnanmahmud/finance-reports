   "Details": "<h3>What is COVID-19 / Coronavirus?</h3><p>There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, \\\"CO\\\" stands for \\\"corona\\\",\\\"VI\\\" for \\\"virus,\\\" and \\\"D\\\" for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as \\\"2019 novel coronavirus\\\"¬ù or \\\"2019-nCo\\\".</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html\">View CDC information</a></p>"

   "Topic": "Coronavirus origins",
   "Details": "<h3>Where it started</h3><p>Like MERS and SARS, COVID-19 closely resembles coronaviruses found in bats but not humans. Scientists believe that the bat virus had a change in its genes that permitted it to spread to humans, possibly via an intermediate carrier (snakes) in an animal market in Wuhan, China. Early on, it is difficult to know the exact source of the virus, how well it spreads from person to person, and how severe the infection is. The virus can be transmitted from person to person via droplets that come from the nose or mouth when\nwe cough or sneeze. Those droplets can directly enter the nose, mouth or eyes of a person standing close by, or they can be indirectly transmitted by hands and inanimate objects.</p>"

   "Topic": "How it spreads",
   "Details": "<h3>How COVID-19  Spreads</h3><p>The virus is thought to spread mainly from <i>person-to-person</i>, especially those who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). The virus spreads through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.</p><p>People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest). While some spread might be possible before people show symptoms, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p><p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p><p>Community spread seems to be happening in some geographic areas. \"\"Community Spread\"\" means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p><p>More details <a href=\"\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\">here</a> from CDC.\"</p>"

Avoid handshakes and hugs ? use smiles and ?hellos? instead. If you prefer physical contact, use fist or elbow bumps.</p><p>Avoid group gatherings, especially in poorly ventilated spaces.

People older than 60 are especially vulnerable to the COVID 19 virus.</p>"
